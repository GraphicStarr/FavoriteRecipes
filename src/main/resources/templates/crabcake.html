    <li>1 lb. jumbo lump or backfin crab meat</li>
    <li>2 slices bread or bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. mayonnaise (light or regular)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. snipped parsley</li>
    <li>1 egg (or substitute for diets</li>
    <li>tartar sauce or cocktail sauce</li>

    the top. Gently toss or fold the ingredients together, taking
    taking care not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.</p>

<p>Form the cakes by hand into patties about 3 inches around
    and 3/4-inch thick. Shape should be like a cookie, not like a
    meatball or golf ball. place the cakes in the refrigerator for
    at least 45 minutes before cooking. This is very important
    so the cake don't fall apart.</p>

<h2>Broil the Crabcakes:</h2>
<p>Slip them under a preheated broiler until nicely browned,
    turning to cook evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.</p>

<h2>Or saute:</h2>
<p>Heat a small amount of butter or olive oil in skillet and
    saute the cakes, turning several times, until golden brown or
    about 8 minutes total cooking time.</p>

<p>Serve at once with tartar sauce, mustard or cocktail sauce
    on the side.</p>>
